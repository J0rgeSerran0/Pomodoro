## Quick introduction about Pomodoro
The *Pomodoro Technique* suggests you how to be more productive in your tasks.

Using the standard values of this technique, 1 pomodoro is equivalent to 25 minutes focused in a work session, plus 5 minutes break.

When we have completed 4 pomodoros with the breaks, we will take a long break of 20 minutes.

This is the general summary of this technique, but you could adapt it to your needs.

The final objective of this, is to have a lot of pomodoros when we finish our daily work.

> When we start a pomodoro, **is very important** to be **focused** in our pomodoro, so you should not be disturbed.

## About this Application

This Windows Application helps you to manage your pomodoros.

You can change the settings adapting the application as you want.

By default, when you finish a pomodoro, a short break or a long break, you will get a sound in your Windows.

You can disable this option, or change the sound that you will find in the **Sounds** folder overwritting the *wav* files by your favorite sounds.

The app running will have this appearance:
